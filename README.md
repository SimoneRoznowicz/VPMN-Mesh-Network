# VPMN-Mesh-Network
The goal of the project is creating an extension of the classical P2P connectivity.</br>
Running the Android application on three different devices A, B and C, given that B detects both A and C but A can't reach C (and viceversa), the purpose is to use device B as a forwarder allowing A and C to communicate despite the distance.</br> </br> 
For the video of the achieved results: [Video_running_application](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16IU-BEIg19_Wc2YLJ8CnEzOfWtyUWEJB/view?usp=sharing)</br>
In this video, even though for logistic reasons the three devices are one next to the other, the central one acts as a forwarder, as if the other two couldn't detect each other (the same result is revealed for physically distant devices).
