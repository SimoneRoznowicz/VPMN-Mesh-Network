# VPMN-Mesh-Network
The goal of the project is creating an extension of the classical P2P connectivity.</br>
Running the Android application on three different devices A, B and C, given that B detects both A and C but A can't reach C (and viceversa), the purpose is to use device B as a forwarder allowing A and C to communicate despite the distnce.</br> </br>
